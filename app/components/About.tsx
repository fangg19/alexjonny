        Actually my full name is{" "}
        <strong itemProp="name">»òerban Alexandru Jonny</strong> and I&apos;m a
        <strong> {getAge()}</strong> years old geeky guy from Bucharest, playing
        on the web.
        <br />
        <br /> Sitting in front of a screen (they were so bad back then) since I
        was 7, I developed a close relationship with the digital and the web,
        making it my playground. After a break of few years I decided to come
        back on playing because like you also I don&apos;t want to grow up and
        be an adult (ew).
