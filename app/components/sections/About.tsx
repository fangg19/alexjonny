          A<strong itemProp="age"> {getAge()}</strong> years old guy based in
          Bucharest, Romania who&apos;s deeply immersed in the world of web
          development and everything digital in general.
          <br />
          <br />
          I got my hands on a computer back in the early 2000s and I&apos;ve
          been playing with it ever since.
          <br /> Sitting in front of a screen for so much (I really need to get
          my eyes checked), I developed a close relationship with the digital
          and the web, making it my playground. After a break of few years I
          decided to come back and make it the main activity of my everyday
          life.
          <br />
          <br />
          I&apos;m a relaxed person who leans towards simplicity and
          practicality, often guided by the question,{" "}
          <strong>&quot;is it really necessary?&quot;</strong>. I enjoy a good
          sense of humor and am consistently prepared for a hearty laugh.
