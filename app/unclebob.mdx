As things started here for real, for the beginning I jumped on adding some simple UI elements and build more complex things over time.

<br />

The biggest feature I worked on involved the whole _checkout segment_, which was a single file with hundreds lines of code, that I refactored it from a React Class based approach, to a Functional one with more components (so I started to spam **useEffects** everywhere).

I also had to develop a new flow for guest users so they can purchase without needing and account.

<br />

Also I've done more things like:

- Substituted Redux with Redux Toolkit within the project.
- Introduced a system for applying discount vouchers to orders.
- Created components and logic to facilitate scheduled deliveries either at the door or within vending machine lockers.
- Added and enhanced Google Enhanced E-commerce functionalities.
- Focused on enhancing page performance and speed, resulting in a Google Lighthouse score increase of more than 30 points.

### UncleBob Warehouse

This project was used for the employees to manage all the logistic behind and e-commerce shop, from stock tracking to users complains.
I maintained it and developed new features, fixed bugs and all that but at some point it was decided that it needs a rewrite (it was also a legacy React Class based app) so I started to work on it on a more modern approach from scratch.
Unfortunately I left before seeing it finished but I believe that the guys managed to finish it.

### Bob Concierge​

These smart lockers/vending machines are designed to be a quick way to buy some essential products or to serve as a locker to leave or pick-up items and to act basically as a concierge.
ReactJS is used for the UI so I had the opportunity to work a little bit on this too, to develop new elements for a better UX.
