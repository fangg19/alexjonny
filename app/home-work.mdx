[My old website ↗](https://old.alexjonny.com)

I developed this site in the summer of 2021 as a personal portfolio. Then after two years I decided that I don't like it anymore and built the current website you are currently on.

It was my first website that I launched in production with a paid custom domain and with a working contact service.
