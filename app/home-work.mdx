Will be extended in the future days.

[Executor Judecatoresc Ochian Doru Catalin ↗](https://executarebucuresti.ro)

I was asked to build this website for a former employee that previously used a Wordpress website for his business.
It needed a redesign also and I tried to do that too (not the best design imho but these were the requirements).

<br />

The most challenging part was to find a way for him to upload the Auctions details and Documents so they can be accessed by the visitors.
So I used Contentful CMS as a headless CMS where he can manage all these things. Every change on Contentful will trigger a redeploy of the website that will generate the static page associated with the Auction.

[My old portfolio ↗](https://old.alexjonny.com)

I developed this site in the summer of 2021 as a personal portfolio. Then after two years I decided that I don't like it anymore and built the current one.
It was my first website that I launched in production.
