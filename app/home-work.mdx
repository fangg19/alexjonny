After developing the website for the former employee, a former colleague that just started into this profession, wanted for the moment just a small landing page with some contact details.

<br />

So I quickly sketched and developed this on a free Saturday. The website will be developed in the future days so it can contain the necessary Auctions page or the essential Documents as in the previous one, a contact form or other features.

I was asked to build this website for a former employee that previously used a Wordpress website for his business.
It needed a redesign also and I tried to do it also (not the best design imho but these were the requests), and I started then to develop it.

<br />

The most challenging part was to find a way for him to upload the Auctions details and Documents so they can be accessed by the visitors.
So I used Contentful CMS as a headless CMS where he can manage all these things. Every change on Contentful will trigger a redeploy of the website that will generate the static page associated with the Auction.

<br />

It was a good start in developing a website by myself that needed more than some hardcoded information.

I developed this site in the summer of 2021 as a personal portfolio. Then after two years I decided that I don't like it anymore and built the current website you are currently on.

It was my first website that I launched in production with a paid custom domain and with a working contact service.
