[Sessions â†—](https://sessions.us)

For sure the most complex app I worked on which helped me a lot in understanding how to handle various problems or how to approach or think about future components of the app.

<br />

I was responsible for many things, where I worked on various features. This
involved developing the user interface and handling the necessary logic, which occasionally
included backend work such as queries and mutations.

<br />

I implemented several new features, some of the most remarkable being:

<br />

- Custom domain name (CNAME) setup so the users can replace the _app.sessions.com_ domain with a custom one.
- Replacing the default favicon with custom options as part of the white labeling feature, so with the CNAME setup and all the theming settings, the whole customization experience would be complete.
- Establishing settings templates for different scenarios so all the various settings (they are a lot) can now be saved as a template that will be used for future sessions of that type (Instant, Planned, Booking, Event or Room).
- Synchronizing personal e-mails for default email usage so any e-mail sent through the app would be sent from your personal e-mail address.
- Implementing the capability to create and present offers during webinars to engage the audience.
- Worked on a Feedback feature that allows participants to send a feedback to the Owner/Assistants of the session, that is visible in the memory for them later in the Memory tab.
- I also worked on the Webinar dynamic page created for an Event.

Obviously I had to fix bugs like every developer. Some caused by me.
