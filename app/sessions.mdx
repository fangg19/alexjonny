[Sessions â†—](https://sessions.us)

For sure the most complex app I've worked, which helped me a lot in understanding how to handle various problems or how to approach or think about future components of the app.

<br />

I was responsible for many things and I worked on various features or struggled to fix bugs. This
involved developing the user interface and handling the necessary logic, which occasionally
included some backend work if there was nobody available to do it.

Working for the first time with GraphQL, Prisma, service workers and all the other tools and services that I've never touched before was a little overwhelming at first but very nice and interesting.

<br />

I worked on several new features, some of the most remarkable being:

<br />

- Establishing settings templates for different scenarios so all the various settings (they are a lot) can now be saved as a template that will be used for future sessions of that type (Instant, Planned, Booking, Event or Room).
- Custom domain name (CNAME) setup so the users can replace the _app.sessions.us_ default domain with a custom one.
- An interface where the user can replace the default favicon with a custom one as part of the whole white labeling feature, so with the CNAME setup and all the theming settings, the whole customization experience would be complete.
- Synchronizing personal e-mails for default email usage so any e-mail sent through the app would be sent from your personal e-mail address.
- Implementing the capability to create and present offers during webinars to engage the audience.
- Worked on a Feedback feature that allows participants to send a feedback to the Owner/Assistants of the session, that is visible in the Memory tab for them later.
- Included AI copilot features for text generating in various scenarios like generating a whole Agenda, an Agenda Item or individually for Agenda Item title or description; A summary generator based on the transcription.
- A search functionality for the transcribed texts generated during a session.
- The Webinar/Event dynamic page created for an Event.

<br />

I also refactored and redesigned some sections such as: Agenda Templates, Agenda during a session, Custom Branding or Events.

<br />

Obviously, I also had to fix bugs like every developer. Some caused by me.
